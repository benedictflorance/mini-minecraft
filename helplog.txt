Nov 20-21: Nick and I worked together to understand why nothing was showing with post-process shaders.
Additionally, refactored ShaderProgram and broke everything. Ultimately we fixed our issue together and
then got advice from Adam on post-process rendering pipeline.

Nov 16: Chun-Fu Yeh helped me in debugging weird holes on the terrain. Eventually we found that it was 
due to not having an expansion timer and checking for expansion/spawning threads super-frequently.

Other than that, I used C++ documentation for std::thread and std::mutex, and classroom lectures and boilerplate
code given by Prof. Adam for the multithreading portion.

Nov 09 : Sebastian Lague is a youtuber with excellent inspiration for procedural terrain. This video served as 
a launch point for my exploration of noise: https://youtu.be/lctXaT9pxA0

Nov 10 : Found the following site helpful for understanding Fractal Noise parameters used to design my FBMs:
	https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/

Otherwise, relied primarily on class lectures and resources describing various noise functions.

Nov 11 9:30 PM : Chun-Fu Yeh helped me in figuring that the Lambert shader had fs_Col had a uniform green color
instead of using vs_Col when I was having trouble with all chunks being rendered in the same color

I used some QT documentation all throughout the work and also used the classroom lecture on Efficient Terrain 
Rendering and Chunking to implement the code.

I followed some youtube tutrials on understanding some shader functions like smoothstep (I forget which one but there are tons online) (November 19, 17: 03)

Question 6
Why is my postprocess shader only showing blue sky?
Answer (Nov 21, 21:20)
Talked to Adam, had to bind the frame buffer before rendering terrain.
Also had to extensively debug with team (thank you team this one was tough)

Other than that I mostly used Documentation online for c++
