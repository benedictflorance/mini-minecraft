Apparently Qt has building bugs when it comes to the ui that have never been addressed according to:
https://forum.qt.io/topic/122810/error-cannot-initialize-object-parameter-of-type-ui_mainwindow-with-an-expression-of-type-ui-mainwindow/5
I fixed the issue by just copying the playerinfo.ui file in forms and manually editing the .pro and whatnot


How can I include an image inside of my inventory widget so it isn't simply text?

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44768106/how-to-display-an-image-with-qt
The above led me to look into the QGraphicsView class
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7138113/qt-graphics-view-show-image-widget
The above conviced me that it is easier to use QLabel and the QPixap class instead

Nov 20-21: Nick and I worked together to understand why nothing was showing with post-process shaders.
Additionally, refactored ShaderProgram and broke everything. Ultimately we fixed our issue together and
then got advice from Adam on post-process rendering pipeline.

Question 1
What is the most efficient way to swap a boolean variable?
Answer (Nov 6, 18:07)

Question 2
How can I change the value of an inherted memeber variable?
Answer (Nov 6, 18:43)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3984215/c-initialization-of-inherited-field

For example:
InputBundle(bool flightModeChange)
    : InputBundle()
{
    flightMode = flightModeChange; // for the player class so it can change the false to true at initialization
};

Question 6
Why is my postprocess shader only showing blue sky?
Answer (Nov 21, 21:20)
Talked to Adam, had to bind the frame buffer before rendering terrain.
Also had to extensively debug with team (thank you team this one was tough)

------------------------
Benedict:
------------------------
Nov 16: Chun-Fu Yeh helped me in debugging weird holes on the terrain. Eventually we found that it was 
due to not having an expansion timer and checking for expansion/spawning threads super-frequently.

Other than that, I used C++ documentation for std::thread and std::mutex, and classroom lectures and boilerplate
code given by Prof. Adam for the multithreading portion.

Nov 09 : Sebastian Lague is a youtuber with excellent inspiration for procedural terrain. This video served as 
a launch point for my exploration of noise: https://youtu.be/lctXaT9pxA0

Nov 10 : Found the following site helpful for understanding Fractal Noise parameters used to design my FBMs:
	https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/

Otherwise, relied primarily on class lectures and resources describing various noise functions.

------------------------
Nov 11 9:30 PM : Chun-Fu Yeh helped me in figuring that the Lambert shader had fs_Col had a uniform green color
instead of using vs_Col when I was having trouble with all chunks being rendered in the same color

I used some QT documentation all throughout the work and also used the classroom lecture on Efficient Terrain 
Rendering and Chunking to implement the code.
