Nov 09 : Sebastian Lague is a youtuber with excellent inspiration for procedural terrain. This video served as 
a launch point for my exploration of noise: https://youtu.be/lctXaT9pxA0

Nov 10 : Found the following site helpful for understanding Fractal Noise parameters used to design my FBMs:
	https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/

Otherwise, relied primarily on class lectures and resources describing various noise functions.

Nov 11 9:30 PM : Chun-Fu Yeh helped me in figuring that the Lambert shader had fs_Col had a uniform green color
instead of using vs_Col when I was having trouble with all chunks being rendered in the same color

I used some QT documentation all throughout the work and also used the classroom lecture on Efficient Terrain 
Rendering and Chunking to implement the code.
