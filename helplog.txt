Milestone 3:

Evan:
------------------------
Used http://dev.thi.ng/gradients/ to design custom cosine color palettes

Adam gave advice to help replace my naive backface culling with the proper OpenGL command.

Otherwise, most of the ideation was driven by an intuitive kind of visual exploration, and I didn't 
use to many outside sources.

Nov 20-21: Nick and I worked together to understand why nothing was showing with post-process shaders.
Additionally, refactored ShaderProgram and broke everything. Ultimately we fixed our issue together and
then got advice from Adam on post-process rendering pipeline.

Nov 16: Chun-Fu Yeh helped me in debugging weird holes on the terrain. Eventually we found that it was 
due to not having an expansion timer and checking for expansion/spawning threads super-frequently.

Other than that, I used C++ documentation for std::thread and std::mutex, and classroom lectures and boilerplate
code given by Prof. Adam for the multithreading portion.

Nov 09 : Sebastian Lague is a youtuber with excellent inspiration for procedural terrain. This video served as 
a launch point for my exploration of noise: https://youtu.be/lctXaT9pxA0

Nov 10 : Found the following site helpful for understanding Fractal Noise parameters used to design my FBMs:
	https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/

Otherwise, relied primarily on class lectures and resources describing various noise functions.

Nov 11 9:30 PM : Chun-Fu Yeh helped me in figuring that the Lambert shader had fs_Col had a uniform green color
instead of using vs_Col when I was having trouble with all chunks being rendered in the same color

I used some QT documentation all throughout the work and also used the classroom lecture on Efficient Terrain 
Rendering and Chunking to implement the code.

Apparently Qt has building bugs when it comes to the ui that have never been addressed according to:
https://forum.qt.io/topic/122810/error-cannot-initialize-object-parameter-of-type-ui_mainwindow-with-an-expression-of-type-ui-mainwindow/5
I fixed the issue by just copying the playerinfo.ui file in forms and manually editing the .pro and whatnot

The above led me to look into the QGraphicsView class
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7138113/qt-graphics-view-show-image-widget
The above conviced me that it is easier to use QLabel and the QPixap class instead
